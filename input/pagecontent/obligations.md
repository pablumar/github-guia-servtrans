### Overview 

Obligations are a mean offered by HL7 FHIR to specify functional capabilities that defined actors MAY, SHOULD or SHALL to the data elements specified by the profiles.

The current choice has been that of defining the obligation in StructureDefinitions distict from those used for defining the structural constraints.

This page describes also the actors that have been defined for specifying the obligations.

### Actors

{% include fsh-link-references.md %}

Three actors have been specifed:
* the [Creator](ActorDefinition-actor-creator-eu-lab.html) ;
* the [Repository](ActorDefinition-actor-repos-eu-lab.html) ; and 
* the [Consumer](ActorDefinition-actor-consumer-eu-lab.html)

The first is the actor creating the report. This report can be send to a consumer or to a repository for report storage and sharing. 
The second actor is the system maintaining a copy of the report received, to store and make it availa√¨ble for the consumers.
The last actor is the system using the report received or retrieved.
